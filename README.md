# Taste Coding Simulation of Fruits (Inspired by Gustatory Cortex)

This project simulates how the gustatory cortex might encode fruit taste profiles using a simplified 4-receptor model and PCA.

## Taste Dimensions
- Sweetness (based on sugar content)
- Sourness (based on acidity)
- Bitterness (estimated)
- 감칠맛 (estimated)

## Fruits
- 살구, 복숭아, 딸기, 사과, 파인애플, 망고, 포도

## How to Run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python taste_model.py
```
